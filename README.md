##### Navigation

### '/' gets us the **Posts** page

### '/createpost' gets us the **Create Post** page

### When clicked on the **"Modify"** button which is available on the each post the application loads the the edit form with preloaded values of the post which we want to edit.

#### Points to remember

## When we are creating a new post it will get appended to the exisiting posts and can be found on the Posts page and there is dynamic search bar which helps to find the post as searched.

## Newly created posts are not edittable as api is not able to find new posts in the backend

#### Thanks!!!
